How to build the project in Win32
=================================


Get the minigolf project
Install GLUT: http://logs.tobinelectronics.com/installing-glut-in-windows-visual-studio-2010/

Run cmake-gui
Where is the source code: path to minigolf folder
Where to build the binaries: minigolf/vs2010

Hit configure.

Visual Studio 10 for VS2010.

There should be errors; fix these accordingly:

GLUI_INCLUDES: minigolf/lib/glui/windows
GLUI_LIBRARIES: minigolf/lib/glui/windows/glui32.lib
^ notice the forward slashes!

Check the 'advanced' checkbox above the config area

GLUT_INCLUDE_DIR: C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0/VC/include
GLUT_glut_LIBRARY: C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0/VC/lib/glut32.lib

Now hit configure again, it should be all clear.
Now hit generate. Then close

Open the minigolf/vs2010 folder. Open the solution file. Switch to RELEASE and build solution.
It should be missing include directories.
Open properties of Minigolf project.
VC++ Directories, Include Directories, click the [...] button.
Add an entry pointing to minigolf/lib/glui/windows
Apply, OK.
Rebuild solution.
Close.
Now minigolf/vs2010/Release folder should contain the two executables.
Copy Minigolf.exe to the minigolf/ folder, as directed in the assignment.
